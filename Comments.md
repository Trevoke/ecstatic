* it would be great to have time-based proprties, aspects, business systems, etc.
* it might prove useful to provide a way to link otherwise unrelated things (e.g., properties) together so that
  if one is deleted, the other is.
* inverse fuction? not sure how often such would be useful other than in debugging, but would it be plausible to incorporate backward
  links so that it would be possible to easily query a property to learn all entities, aspects, etc. that it is a part of?
